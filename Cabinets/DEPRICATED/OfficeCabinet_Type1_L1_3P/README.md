## Sheets and Explanation

Main power of the cabinet. In this Type 1 the power is [**3 phase**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power).

**Clients Terminals** are terminals where the clients power lines are connects to the cabinet. Clients are sourcing power from it. This power has been measured and analysed by power analyser. The data has been sent to the main [**ERP**](https://bgerp.com/) of the building.

Sensors of the system are divided by few sheets, they are used to measure the parameters of the environment of the target zone. At this sheet this is tampers switches and PIR sensor. All active signals are connected through terminals to the main PLC of the cabinet.
